# SpaceView Project

The Space View Project encourages us to explore the universe by searching for Planets,
Stars, and Nebulae. Powered by the NASA API, beautiful images and descriptions return. 
If no results are found, helpful hints appear which show explorers possible searches
to try.

### Motivation
I want to inspire wonder for the universe by making the amazing artifacts available 
from the NASA website more easily accessible, starting with Planets, Stars, and Nebulae.

### Technology
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery

### API
- images.nasa.gov API
- https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#Images

### Summary
- On first view, the SpaceView Project shows options to search by Planet, Star, or 
Nebulae.
- She is able to click on any of those choices
-  She types in an item inside that category, and clicks Search.
- If the name matches the title or description of an image in the NASA Image and Video 
Library, then up to five results will show on her screen. 
- If no results are found, she is shown new options to try. 
- She may choose to search again, start over, or search in another category. 
- Any results images are clickable to link out to the NASA site, along with link beneath.
- SpaceView may be enjoyed on any viewport size; mobile, tablet, desktop

### Screenshots

Placeholder TEXT

### Further Information on Accessibility
- The background for the SpaceView Project on desktop and tablet size viewports is a 
gradient set in the css. The range of color in the gradient is from #E1E6E3 to #A4EEE9.
I verified the contrast ratio is over 12:1 for both, compared to the text color used
in the app. When running AXE to verify accessibility on Chrome, there was an error
returned that it could not verify contrast because a gradient is being used. 

### Next Steps
- Add a logo! I'd like to add a spiral similar to the favicon to the end of the text. I 
like the current font, and a vector image will make it pop.
- Update the JavaScript to consolidate repeating (ie: page html) code into
separate functions.
- Add more search options; Space Stations, Telescopes, Missions, Moons, Space Probes, 
Asteroids.

### Credits
Thank you to Marc, Joe, Katie, and Skandar for awesome feedback while I was building
out the app.
